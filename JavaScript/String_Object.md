# The String Object
The **String** object in javascript lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.

As javascript automatically converts between string primitive and string objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the string object on a string primitive.

The String is a sequence of characters containing 0 or more characters. For example, "Hello" is a string.

JavaScript strings can be created as objects using the `String()` constructor or as primitives using string literals.

## Syntax
```js
const val = new String(value);
```

We can create string primitives using string literals and the **String()** function as follows:
```js
str1 = 'hello world!!'  // using single quote
str2 = "Hello World!"; // using double quote 
str3 = 'Hello World'; // using back ticks 
str4 = String('Hello World!'); // using String() function
```

## Creating javascript string objects
```js
const str = new String("Hello World!")
console.log(typeof str)

// output
object
```

## Accessing a string
You can access the string characters using its index. The string index starts from 0.

```js
let str = "Linux-DEX"
console.log(str[0])
console.log(str[7])

// output
L
E
```

## Strings are Case-sensitive
In javascript, strings are case-sensitive. It means lowercase and uppercase characters are different.

```js
let char1 = 's'
let char2 = 'S'
let ans = char1 == char2
console.log(ans)

// output
false
```

## Strings are Immutable
In javascript, you can't change the characters of the string. However, you can update the whole string.
```js
let str = "Linux"
str[0] = "U"
console.log(str)
str = "DEX"
console.log(str)

// output
Linux
DEX
```

## Escape character

| Escape Character | Description     |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| \\"              | Double quote    |
| \\'              | Single quote    |
| \\\\             | Backslash       |
| \\n              | New line        |
| \\t              | Tab             |
| \\b              | backSpace       |
| \\f              | Form feed       |
| \\v              | Vertical tab    |
| \\r              | Carriage return |
| \\uXXXX          | unicode escape  |

### Example
```js
let str1 = "Your\'s Welcome!!"
let str2 = "Backslash \\"
console.log(str1)
console.log(str2)

// output
Your's Welcome!
Backslash \
```
