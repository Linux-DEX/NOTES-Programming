# Operator

In Javascript, an **operator** is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands, such as variable or values, and returns a result.

Javascript supports the following types of operators.
+ Arithmetic Operators
+ Comparison Operators
+ Logical (or relational) Operators
+ Bitwise Operators
+ Assignment Operators
+ Miscellaneous Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description    | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| +        | Addition       | x + y   |
| -        | Substracts     | x - y   |
| *        | Multiplication | x * y   |
| /        | Division       | y/x     |
| %        | Modulus        | y % x   |
| ++       | Increment      | x++     |
| --       | Decreases      | x--     |

## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description              | Example |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| ==       | Equal                    | x == y  |
| !=       | Not Equal                | x != y  |
| = = =    | Strict equal             | x === y |
| !==      | Strict inequal           | x !== y |
| >        | Greater than             | x > y   |
| <        | Less than                | x < y   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | x >= y  |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | x <=y   |

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example  |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| &&       | Logical AND | x && y   |
| \|\|     | Logical OR  | x \|\| y |
| !        | Logical NOT | !y       |
## Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Description           | Example |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| &        | Bitwise AND           | x & y   |
| \|       | Bitwise OR            | x \| y  |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR           | x ^ y   |
| \~       | Bitwise Notes         | \~y     |
| <<       | Left Shift            | x << 1  |
| >>       | Right Shift           | x >> 1  |
| >>>      | Right shift with zero | x >>> 1 |

## Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description              | Example   |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| =        | Simple assignment        | z = y + x |
| +=       | Add and Assignment       | x +=y     |
| -=       | Substract and Assignment | z -= x    |
| \*\=     | Multiply and Assignment  | z \*\= x  |
| /=       | Divide and Assignment    | z /= x    |
| %=       | Modules and Assignment   | z %= x    |

## Miscellaneous operators

| Operator | Description                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ?  :     | Conditional                                                         |
| typeof   | return data type                                                    |
| ??       | Nullish coalescing Operator                                         |
| delete   | remove property from an object                                      |
| ,        | it evaluates its operands and return the value of the last operands |
| ()       | Grouping                                                            |
| yield    | used to pause and resume a generator function                       |
| ...      | Spread                                                              |
| **       | Exponentiation                                                      |
