# Comments
JavaScript comments are used to explain the purpose of the code.

**There are two common ways to write comments in javascript:**
  + Single-Line Comments
  + Multi-line Comments

## Single-line comments
We can start the single-line comment with the **double forward slash(//)**.

### Syntax
```js
<script>
	// single-line comment message
</script>
```

### Example
```js
<script>
// defining the string1
var string1 = "javascript";
// defining the string2
var string2 = "typescript";
// Printing the strings
document.write(string1, " ", string2);
</script>
```

## Multi-line comments
The multi-line comment is useful when we require to comment the multiple line of code or explain the larger codes. We can write multi-line comments between the `/* and */`

### syntax
```js
<script>
/* First line of comment message
The second line of the comment message */
</script>
```

### Example
```js
<script>
var a = 100;
var b = 200;

/* a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b; */
</script>
```
